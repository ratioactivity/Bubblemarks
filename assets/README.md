# Bubblemarks Decorative Assets

Drop your sparkle GIFs, pastel stickers, or the wandering axolotl sprites into this folder.

The interface looks for:

- Optional star/heart GIFs referenced from CSS classes (see `style.css`).
- The axolotl animation frames inside an `assets/axolotl/` subfolder. Create the folder and place your sequence inside to bring the mascot to life.

Because the repo is distributed without media, you can keep your licensed artwork private while the UI falls back to CSS-generated sparkles. Add the files locally and refresh to see them.
